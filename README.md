## üß† Overview  
Built with .NET 9 and deployed to Azure App Service, this project delivers a production-grade REST API with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation, health monitoring, semantic versioning, and environment-specific configuration. CI/CD automation is handled through GitHub Actions and Azure CLI. The headless front end connects directly to Azure endpoints using React 18, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, forming a fast, modular, and modern full-stack web application.

## üîí Security Note
Swagger UI is intentionally enabled in production for this portfolio project to allow easy API testing and demonstration. In a real-world application with sensitive data, Swagger would typically be restricted to development environments only.
