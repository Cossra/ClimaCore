## ☁️ Overview  
This cloud-native API powers the ClimaCore frontend, delivering structured weather data consumed by a **React 18 built with TypeScript & Vite** client hosted on Azure Static Web Apps.  

Built natively for **Azure App Service**, it leverages platform-level scaling, monitoring, and deployment capabilities. Continuous integration and delivery are automated through **GitHub Actions** and **Azure CLI**, ensuring seamless updates and reliable production performance across both environments.

---

## 📘 API Documentation  
Implemented OpenAPI/Swagger-based contract-first design, enabling parallel frontend/backend development and continuous integration testing - UI is intentionally enabled in production for demonstration and portfolio purposes. 

---

## 🧩 Agile User Story  
**As a user**  
**I want** to check free, real-time weather updates online.  
**So that** I can quickly see current conditions wherever I am.
